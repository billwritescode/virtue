virtue - better than VICE
VIRTUE is a chess engine forked (March 3 2015) from the VICE engine by BlueFeverSoft, after the video series ended at chapter 95. To my knowledge there hasn't been any updates since 2014. The purpose of this engine is pedagogy, learning, and to give back to the community. 

## WHAT I'M DOING
I am addressing deficiencies in style and playing strenth in VICE. The goal of VICE was to give an intro to chess programming. The intent of virtue is to develop and craft from VICE a strong, pretty, well-commented (perhaps excessively), and pedagogically interesting chess engine.

### COMPILING
In the "virtue" folder, compile with make.
`make`

### RUNNING
#### WINDOWS
`vice.exe`
#### LINUX
`vice`

### SYSTEMS
Written and tested on Ubuntu Linux when wireless works. Otherwise Windows 7, where I am less liable to break wireless drivers in my spare time.
